The DistributedDownloader is a MapReduce/HIPI program that creates a HipiImageBundle (HIB) from a set of images downloaded over the Internet.
This set is specified as a list of URLs and it can be generated in many different ways.
For example, you might create a list of image URLs by scraping a website that contains photo collections like Flickr, Google Images, Bing, or Instagram.
